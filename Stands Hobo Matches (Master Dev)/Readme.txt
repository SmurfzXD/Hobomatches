Version 1.0

- Added New Match and Match Box items
- (2) Matches can be combined into a match box which then will accept matches up to 32 per box.
- Matches can be removed from the match box to be used for smokeable items and campfires
- Matches to drop regularly off of dead NPC stalkers.

**TO DO**

Allow either Matches or the Matchbox to be used for smokeables and campfires
